# 🎥 Movie Recommendation System – ML Project Overview

A machine-learning powered recommendation engine built using Collaborative Filtering, Matrix Factorization, Content-Based Filtering, and a Hybrid Model. This document summarizes the complete workflow followed from data collection to final deployment-ready output.


## 📌 Data Preparation
- Collected dataset (MovieLens / Amazon Reviews / custom user–item data).
- Cleaned and preprocessed records.
- Handled missing values and normalized rating scales.
- Performed EDA to understand user-item interactions and rating patterns.


## 📌 Collaborative Filtering & Matrix Factorization
- Implemented User-Based and Item-Based Collaborative Filtering models.
- Built Matrix Factorization models using SVD and NMF.
- Evaluated model accuracy using RMSE, MAE, and Precision@K.
- Documented model performance and observations.


## 📌 Content-Based & Hybrid System
- Used TF-IDF on movie metadata to generate content similarity scores.
- Combined collaborative and content-based outputs to build a Hybrid Recommender.
- Integrated an optional user feedback mechanism for adaptive improvements.


## 📌 Dashboard & Final Documentation
- Created a simple demo dashboard/web interface to display recommendations.
- Compared all models and visualized results.
- Prepared final documentation with:
  - Evaluation charts  
  - Model comparison tables  
  - Use-case scenarios  
  - Key findings and insights  


## ✅ Final Output
- End-to-end hybrid recommendation pipeline  
- Multiple models trained, evaluated, and compared  
- Dashboard-ready demonstration system  
- Complete documentation and visual reporting
